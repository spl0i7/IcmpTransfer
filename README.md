# IcmpTransfer
Icmp file transfer implementation. This can be used to transfer file over ICMP altough it's kind of crude now but it kind of works.
# Bugs
memory leakage in server ( had to Ctrl+C to exit server and stop receiving file)

packet loss ( packet loss is not checked )

low speed ( atmost around 2 Mbps )
